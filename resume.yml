projects:
  - name: Atm-Interface
    url: 
    affiliation: SRM Institute of Science and Technology
    startDate: 2023-07-10
    endDate: 2023-11-25
    highlights:
      - Create an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for the ATM system. Design the interface to resemble a real ATM machine, with options for withdrawing cash, depositing funds, checking balance, transferring money, and other common banking operations.
      - Implement robust transaction handling mechanisms to ensure the security and realiability of the ATM system. Include features such as authentication (e.g., PIN verification), transaction logging, error handling , and encryption to protect sensitive user data and financial transactions.
  - name: Restaraunt Management System
